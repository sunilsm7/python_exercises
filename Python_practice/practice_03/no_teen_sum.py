"""

Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum.
However, if any of the values is a teen -- in the range 13..19 inclusive -- 
then that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as a teens.
Write a separate helper "def fix_teen(n):"that takes in an int value 
and returns that value fixed for the teen rule.
In this way, you avoid repeating the teen code 3 times (i.e. "decomposition").
Define the helper below and at the same indent level as the main no_teen_sum().


no_teen_sum(1, 2, 3) == 6
no_teen_sum(2, 13, 1) == 3
no_teen_sum(2, 1, 14) == 3
