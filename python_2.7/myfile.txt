We have to point out one possible problem: 
What happens if you open a file for writing, and this file already exists.
Be happy,
if you had a backup of this file,
if you need it, because as soon as an open() with a "w" has been executed the file will be removed.
This is often what you want,
but sometimes you just want to append to the file,
like it's the case with logfiles
