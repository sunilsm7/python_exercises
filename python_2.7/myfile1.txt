1 : We have to point out one possible problem: 
2 : What happens if you open a file for writing, and this file already exists.
3 : Be happy,
4 : if you had a backup of this file,
5 : if you need it, because as soon as an open() with a "w" has been executed the file will be removed.
6 : This is often what you want,
7 : but sometimes you just want to append to the file,
8 : like it's the case with logfiles
