You have already seen you can use +  operator for adding numbers and at the same time to concatenate strings. It is possible because +  operator is overloaded by both int  class and str  class. The operators are actually methods defined in respective classes. Defining methods for operators is known as operator overloading. For e.g. To use +  operator with custom objects  you need to define a method called __add__  .

Letâ€™s take an example to understand better


import math

class Circle:

    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.__radius = radius

    def setRadius(self, radius):
        self.__radius = radius

    def getRadius(self):
        return self.__radius

    def area(self):
        return math.pi * self.__radius ** 2

    def __add__(self, another_circle):
        return Circle( self.__radius + another_circle.__radius )

c1 = Circle(4)
print(c1.getRadius())

c2 = Circle(5)
print(c2.getRadius())

c3 = c1 + c2 # This became possible because we have overloaded + operator by adding a    method named __add__
print(c3.getRadius())

print(c2.getRadius())

print(c3.getRadius())

In the above example we have added __add__  method which allows use to use +  operator to add two circle objects. Inside the __add__  method we are creating a new object and returning it to the caller.

python has many other special methods like __add__ , see the list below.

OPERATOR	FUNCTION	  METHOD DESCRIPTION
+ 	  __add__(self, other) 	 Addition
* 	  __mul__(self, other) 	 Multiplication
- 	  __sub__(self, other) 	 Subtraction
% 	  __mod__(self, other) 	 Remainder
/ 	  __truediv__(self, other) 	 Division
< 	  __lt__(self, other) 	 Less than
<= 	  __le__(self, other) 	 Less than or equal to
== 	  __eq__(self, other) 	 Equal to
!= 	  __ne__(self, other) 	 Not equal to
> 	  __gt__(self, other) 	Greater than
>= 	  __ge__(self, other) 	 Greater than or equal to
[index] 	  __getitem__(self, index) 	 Index operator
in 	  __contains__(self, value) 	Check membership
len 	__len__(self) 	 The number of elements
str 	__str__(self) 	 The string representation
Program below is using some of the above mentioned functions to overload operators.

    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.__radius = radius

    def setRadius(self, radius):
        self.__radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return math.pi * self.__radius ** 2

    def __add__(self, another_circle):
        return Circle( self.__radius + another_circle.__radius )

    def __gt__(self, another_circle):
        return self.__radius > another_circle.__radius

    def __lt__(self, another_circle):
        return self.__radius < another_circle.__radius

    def __str__(self):
        return "Circle with radius " + str(self.__radius)

c1 = Circle(4)
print(c1.getRadius())

c2 = Circle(5)
print(c2.getRadius())

c3 = c1 + c2
print(c3.getRadius())

print( c3 > c2) # Became possible because we have added __gt__ method

print( c1 < c2) # Became possible because we have added __lt__ method

print(c3) # Became possible because we have added __str__ method
